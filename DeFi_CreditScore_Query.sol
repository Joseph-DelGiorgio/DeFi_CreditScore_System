// An example of how the pseudocode for the algorithm to query the Ethereum blockchain for information about which DeFi products are used by 
// a given Ethereum address could be implemented in the Solidity programming language:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract QueryDefiProducts {
  // Address of the MakerDAO contract
  address makerDAOContractAddress;

  // Address of the AAVE contract
  address aaveContractAddress;

  constructor(address _makerDAOContractAddress, address _aaveContractAddress) public {
    makerDAOContractAddress = _makerDAOContractAddress;
    aaveContractAddress = _aaveContractAddress;
  }

  function query(address ethereumAddress) public view returns (bool isUsingMakerDAO, bool isUsingAAVE) {
    // Query the MakerDAO contract to see if the address has any open CDPs
    isUsingMakerDAO = MakerDAO(makerDAOContractAddress).openCdp(ethereumAddress) != 0;

    // Query the AAVE contract to see if the address has any open loans or deposits
    UserAccount storage userAccount = AAVE(aaveContractAddress).getUserAccount(ethereumAddress);
